    <h2>About Our Project</h2>
    <p>
      In rural areas, lack of proper transportation facilities often makes it difficult for people 
      to access healthcare during emergencies. Many lives are at risk simply because medical support 
      is not available at the right time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our solution, <b>RuralHealthAI</b>, is an AI-powered healthcare platform that bridges this gap. 
      By providing instant doctor consultations, digital prescriptions, nearby pharmacy details, and 
      emergency medical guidance, we aim to save time and save lives.
